# Accessible Fighting Games

# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to allow any player to execute any complex command in any fighting game with a single button press.

Fighting games are amazing and interesting, but are also hard.

This project is for casual players who want to enjoy a game without absurd motor execution requirements

This project is for people with motor disabilities

# Is this cheating?

My method automates keyboard events on Operating System level. It does not interact with any game process, so you will not be detected as cheater and banned.

My method is not meant to be used online competitively against real people. But if you do, you will quickly discover that this method is a fun way to enjoy a game, but it is not performant competitively

# How it works

This project uses a tool called [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) , please install it.

This project contains sample scripts for autohotkey. In this readme I will examine a number of code snippets in order to teach you to create your own scripts for your character in your fighting game.
